How to use it
=============
For a plain heading, just type in some text and an ascii-art styled heading comment will be produced.

If you click on the settings button you can add things like version number, code authors and copyright information.
In settings you can now also change what comment style is used (ie: C++, C, Bash, HTML).

More features are to come.

This program has the following dependencies:

 - GTK+-3.0
 - Valac

Any system with these on it should be able to run it.
